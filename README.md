# Reinforcement-Learning-Automated-Taxi-Driver-Problem-using-Q-Learning-Algorithm
A Python application that makes use of Q-Learning algorithm to solve the Automated Taxi-Driver Problem for Self-Driving Cars. The agent makes use of Reinforcement Learning and updates the Q-Table to learn the environment. After the learning is done, the agent (taxi) pick-ups the customer and drops the customer to appropriate destination.
